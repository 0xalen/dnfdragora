This file is meant to get a list of things that should be hopefully implemented or fixed
as soon as possible. 

1. Repository update, TransactionProgress::update gets wrong information
   e.g. the number of file (always 1) and not its size so dowload progress
   bar is always wrong (need upstream interaction)
2. Theme management icons are taken from mageia system. A default theme should
   be provided.
3. Group management, upstream rpm seems not to manage groups any more at least in 
   the way mageia does, we should allow a configuration key to enable/disable mageia
   behaviour and manage group in a standard way for other systems.
4. Repositories/mirror management
5. Keys management (needed?)
6. Add a configuration file, and a user one to save settings eventually.
7. String localization, all is ready but gettext is not used
8. libyui, we need to ask for a patch review concerning YItem selection needed to manage
   package selection and released on github by anaselli.
